# PersonalWebsite
Repository for my personal website


Once upon a time, in a land not so far away (the same land as from where I operate now :) ) I had a completely different career: I worked in the soft-skilled environment of educational development, writing, training and coaching on the subject of philosophy- and worldview education. These days I still write and develop a lot, but just in different languages than before. Way different. I have a beautiful website which represents my old work, and as a developer I am rebuilding that website in raw code in stead of the wordpress theme I first made the website in.
